/*Implement the solution using a C Program. A Book Shelf has to be arranged such that 
the books with more number of pages are placed first in the shelf followed by books with less number of pages. 
That book shelf can store ‘n’ books. 
Read the value for n and number of pages for each book.
1) Display the order in which books are arranged in the shelf.
Example: if n=5, Book1=120, Book2=30, Book3=98, Book4=873 Book5=500
The order is 873 500 120 98 30
2) Find the book which has least number of pages. 
3) Find the book with maximum number of pages
4) Find the number of books which has odd number of pages and even number of pages.
Use functions and pointers to implement the solution.*/
