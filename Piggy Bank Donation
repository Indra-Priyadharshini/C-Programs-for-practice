/*Assume there are five children named A,B,C,D and E in a family. All of them have saved money in a piggy bank.
Their school voluntary donation camp is looking for some money Rs. X.
Parents have told the children that any three of them can offer money if the sum of any three of their money is equal to Rs.X.
Read the savings amount of children in an array and donation amount in X variable. Find out the combination of children, whose sum of money is equal to X. 
Print, the respective children names and their savings amount. If the combination does not exist, print “Donation can’t be paid”. */
