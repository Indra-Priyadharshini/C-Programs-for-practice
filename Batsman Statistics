{2,1,0,0,4,6,0,1,1,4,4,4,1,1,0,0,4,4,0,0,2,2,6,6} is the runs scored by a batsman for 4 overs in an ODI. Write a C program to print 
1) the number of dot balls he faced 2) the number of single runs 3) the number of 2s runs 4) the number of boundaries 5) the number of sixes and
6) the total number of runs he scored. 
The scores of the same batsman in the other matches of the series is {40,55,20,5}. Calculate and display the average of runs he has scored in the series.*/
