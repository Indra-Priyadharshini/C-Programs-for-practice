/*Soniya works in a city, distant from her native.  She visits her native frequently atleast once a month. The travel cost of visiting her native is Rs. 1500. 
Get the input from user, the no.of times the visit has been made to native in the year 2021.  Calculate and print the total travel cost of the year 2021.
Define a recursive function to calculate the travel cost. Let the function takes two arguments 1) no.of visits 2)cost of visit.
Do not use * (asheriks) operator for multiplying values, instead use recursion to calculate the total cost and print the result in main function. 
Sample Input:
5
Sample Output:
Rs.7500*/
#include <stdio.h>

int Total_Cost(int n)
{
    if (n == 1) return 1500;
    return 1500 + Total_Cost(n-1);
}

int main()
{
    int n;
    scanf("%d", &n);
    
    int res = Total_Cost(n);
    
    printf("Rs.%d", res);
    return 0;
